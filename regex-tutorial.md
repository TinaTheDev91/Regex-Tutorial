# HEX Code Regex Tutorial

* Matching a Hex Value: `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

To start, a Regex or Regular Expression is a series of different characters used to create a search pattern in code. When using these expressions, you are able to find text based on your desired pattern/format as well as manipulate the acquired text to suit your goal. These expressions are commonly used to determine if a user's new password meets a website's requirements or if a user's email is valid. As you dive further into this tutorial, you'll learn how a HEX code Regex is used and structured.

## Summary

A HEX code Regular Expression allows users to validate HEX (or Hexadecimal) color codes. These codes are often used spaces such as web development and design (ie, illustration and graphic design). When we see the code indicated among platforms, it is typically denoted with a '#' symbol, followed by a series of 6 characters which are a combination of both numbers and letters. The HEX Code Regex is as follows:

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`
